## Repository Contents

### Featured Implementation: 100 Prisoners and a Lightbulb

The main.cpp file contains a simulation of the classic probability puzzle where prisoners must devise a strategy to determine when all 100 prisoners have visited a room with a single lightbulb.

**Implemented Strategies:**
- **DedicatedCounterPrisoner** — One designated counter tracks visits by counting light toggles
- **TokenPrisoner** — More sophisticated token-passing strategy with staged communication

**Technical Features:**
- Template-based Prison simulation framework
- Monte Carlo simulation for strategy comparison
- Probability calculations using combinatorics
- Binary search for parameter optimization
- Unit tests with assertions
